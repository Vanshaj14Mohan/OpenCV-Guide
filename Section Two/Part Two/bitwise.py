# In this we will learn about bitwise operations using OpenCV.
# Bitwise operations are used to manipulate binary images. Especially useful in masking operations.
# At a very high level, these operations work on the binary representation of the pixel values. that is 0s and 1s.
# There are four types of bitwise operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR.
